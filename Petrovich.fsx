(* Petrovich provides two methods of influencing its behaviour: rewards and punishments. 
Whenever Petrovich does something the user doesn't approve of, the user can punish it. 
Conversely, whenever Petrovich does something useful, the user can reward it. 
Petrovich then adapts its behaviour to avoid punishment and enjoy more rewards. *)
